# Conerstone Hall Classroom Reservation Server

### What does this project do?
This project brings in a 3D modeling Cornerstone Hall to show visually and provide a classroom reservation server.

### Why is this project useful?
This project is useful because it provides a service that student can use classroom only at a set time.

### How do I get started?
Once I model Cornerstone in 3D from a tool called Revit, I should think about how we can upload this data to a server. I'm thinking and searching about it.

### Where can I get more help, if I need it?
I will borrow related books from the school library.
