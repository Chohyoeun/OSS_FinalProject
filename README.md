This project is useful because it provides a service that informs users of space information in Cornerstone Hall.

### How do I get started?
Once I model Cornerstone in 3D from a tool called Revit, I should think about how we can upload this data to a server. I'm thinking and searching about it.

I will borrow related books from the school library.
